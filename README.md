# 📧 Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

Spam Detection is a machine learning project designed to classify messages or emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system analyzes text data, extracts meaningful features, and predicts whether a message is unwanted or legitimate.

Spam detection is widely used in email filtering, SMS filtering, cybersecurity, and content moderation systems.
